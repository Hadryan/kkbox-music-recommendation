1. Un-terminated quotations in the songs.csv file cause you to lose about 513 songs when you read the file with Pandas. This is relatively easy to fix and I posted a [Kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/alexklibisz/songs-csv-quote-errors-cause-513-missing-songs).
2. Un-terminated quotations in the song_extra_info.csv file cause you to lose about 1000 songs when you read the file with Pandas. Again, this is relatively easy to fix the same way as number 1.
3. There are many songs (~10K IIRC) that are duplicates on all columns except song_id. If you use the song_id as the unique identifier, you'll find ~419K unique songs in the train and test sets. If you use the combination of all other song columns (length, language, name, artist, composer, â€¦), you'll find ~410K unique songs in the dataset.
4. There is a post about some Chinese language translations for "missing artists". I don't speak Mandarin, etc. so cannot provide much insight on it.
